# DocAssist - (Building Intelligent Medical Decision Support System)

## Project Overview

DocAssist aims to develop an intelligent medical decision support system that leverages machine learning and data analysis to assist doctors in making informed decisions about the best treatment options for individual patients. By analyzing patient data, such as medical history, symptoms, lab results, and other relevant factors, the system will provide personalized treatment recommendations to enhance clinical decision-making.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather comprehensive patient data from electronic health records (EHRs), medical databases, and other relevant sources while ensuring data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and handle missing values in the patient data to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and extract meaningful features from the patient data.
4. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to predict treatment outcomes based on patient data.
5. **Treatment Recommendations**: Create an algorithm to generate personalized treatment recommendations.
6. **Model Interpretability**: Implement methods to interpret the model's predictions and provide insights to doctors.
7. **User Interface**: Design an intuitive user interface for doctors to input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.

## Deliverables

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing Pipeline**: A robust pipeline to collect, clean, and preprocess patient data.
2. **Treatment Recommendation Algorithm**: An algorithm that generates treatment recommendations.
3. **Model Interpretability Report**: A report detailing the interpretability methods used.
4. **Project Report (PDF)**: Includes:
   - Description of design choices and performance evaluation of the model.
   - Discussion of future work.
   - Source code used to create the pipeline.
5. **Source Code**: All source code used in the project, including scripts for data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and user interface.

## Tasks and Activities

### Data Collection
- Gather patient data from EHRs and medical databases.
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess patient data to handle missing values and remove noise.
- Anonymize and encrypt sensitive patient information for security.

### Feature Engineering
- Extract relevant features from patient data, such as demographics, medical history, and diagnostic results.
- Transform categorical variables into numerical representations.

### Model Development
- Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, neural networks).
- Train the models using the preprocessed patient data.

### Model Interpretability
- Implement methods such as feature importance to interpret the models' predictions.

### User Interface
- Design a user-friendly interface that allows doctors to input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.
- Ensure data security and confidentiality in the user interface.

## Success Metrics
- High accuracy and precision in predictive models for treatment outcomes.
- Positive feedback from doctors on the usefulness and effectiveness of the treatment recommendations.

## Bonus Points
- Implement explainable AI techniques to enhance model interpretability.
- Incorporate patient feedback and outcome data to continuously improve treatment recommendations.
- Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and data privacy laws throughout the project.
